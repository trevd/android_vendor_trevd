vendor/trevd
============

This adds a signed_ product to the lunch menu and signs the builds
using the key set in PRODUCT_DEFAULT_DEV_CERTIFICATE.
At the moment this is just a copy of the build/target/product/testkeys but
this "tricks" the build system into naming them as devkeys.

Obviously this is not for any serious distribution but does show an example
of how you can sign the builds

security/make_keys is an helper script should you wish to generate some
real keys edit the CERT variable in the script to the appropriate values
