vendor/trevd
============

This adds a signed_ product to the lunch menu and signs the builds
using the key set in PRODUCT_DEFAULT_DEV_CERTIFICATE.
At the moment this is just a copy of the build/target/product/testkeys but
this "tricks" the build system into naming them as devkeys.

Obviously this is not for any serious distribution but does show an example
of how you can sign the builds

security/make_keys is an helper script should you wish to generate some
real keys edit the CERT variable in the script to the appropriate values


vewndorsetup.sh adds extra functionality to the android build environment
This is included automatically when build/envsetup.sh is run


Functions :
mmp:     Builds all of the modules in the current directory and pushes them to the device.
_get_adb_device - 	get a connect device. A valid device is determined by the first match device
					of the following build system variable in the following order of precedence
				    1. PRODUCT_MODEL
				    2. TARGET_PRODUCT
				    2. TARGET_DEVICE

setupp_ccache : Setup a build id specific ccache. This is useful if you maintain multiple code bases
				especially if those code bases differ in versions.
